				"&o&3 9S : Hey 4R, how would you rate the realism of NuclearCraft?"

				"&o&c : The reactor design isn't very, it's more of a puzzle than actually trying to be realistic IIRC"
				"&o&c : But the isotope chains are solid"
				"&o&7 2W : The main pieces of overhaul reactors that are definitely not realistic are the heat sink puzzle, neutron flux mechanics, and the various heat multiplier and efficiency bonuses/penalties"
				"&o&7 : The only thing I know for sure can definitely be improved without making things too annoying for the average player is the overfluxing mechanic, which currently has the weird effect of reducing the efficiency of the cell without modifying its heat output"
				"&o&7 : Stuff like the placement puzzle is defo at odds with how the designing a reactor’s heat dissipation is actually done, but I think it’s a worthwhile gamification"
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"&o&4 49 : what's the purpose for alternating flux wires? do they transfer HV flux across a longer distance?"
				"&o&7 2W : My idea was pretty much based on the very crude simplification that the cross-section for fission is a very simple monotonically decreasing function of neutron energy"
				"&o&7 : The actual maths NCO uses is just one particular example of that"
				"&o&7 : If you or 7I have a good idea for what should happen if a cell receives too much flux, and also what “too much” should count as in the first place, let me know"
				"&o&3 9S : Imagine a cursed minecraft mod about nuclear reactors where they are as realistic as the limits of modding allow and you have to do all the math as if it was an actual nuclear reactor"

				"&o&3 9S : Who wouldn't want to spend hours learning actual nuclear physics just to use some random minecraft mod"
