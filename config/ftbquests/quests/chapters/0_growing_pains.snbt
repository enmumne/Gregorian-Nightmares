				"The old description used to say:"
				"&oYou can use the furnace for this but you'll need a steady supply of coal. We suggest setting up a small assembly line that takes copper and tin and produces bronze ingots."
				""
				"Of course the path to obtain a &eBronze Ingot&r has been slightly cursed."
				""
				"The dust cannot be smelted until the Steam Blast Furnace. I hope you set up at least one blaze burner for a mixer, because you need 5 bronze dusts and melt them."
				""
				"Once in molten form, you can move that fluidified bronze into a basin, and turn it into a bronze ingot with a press."
				""
				"The heated mixer step was originally skippable by smelting tiny dusts into nuggets, then compacting them. The process is now unified, so you alternatively melt a full bronze dust or nuggets or tiny dusts. Yields slightly vary but not exactly worth the additional annoyance."
				""
				"Ancient history continues here:"
				"&oCongratulations, you've got your first Bronze Ingot. Time to move on to the Steam chapter to start with your first few Modern Industrialization machines."
				"&oFrom here on, recipes will become more expensive, expansive and complex. We recommend crafting more than you need, as often as you can. You'll eventually use everything up as you progress through the pack."
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Problems may arise when you're trying to melt that bronze into a mixer..."
				""
				"5 bronze dusts become 585 units of molten bronze. What to do with this? You need to send the fluid over to a press and a basin, to compact it into ingots. But you can't pick that fluid with a bucket, because a bucket is a whole 1k unit and it cannot pick fractions. So you may try to melt two batches, 585 + 585 = 1170. That would exceed the 1k, and let you pick it up."
				""
				"But this mixer basin only holds 1k max. Therefore after you throw in the basin the second batch for bronze, the mixer won't even start making the recipe, because it doesn't have enough capacity left for all that fluid."
				""
				"If you also try to directly pump out the molten bronze, you'll likely find more problems."
				""
				"The not so intuitive solution is that you have to place a Create drain right next to the basin, but &eone block below&r (basically, next to the blaze burner). If done correctly, a funnel will automatically appear at the side of the basin, directed toward the drain. The molten bronze will then be automatically dumped into the drain, freeing the basin so you can process more. If from there you link a mechanical pump, leading out into a Create spout, and then you put a depot under the spout, with an empty bucket (iron bucket, of course), then the spout will be filled to 1k, and then fill the bucket, that you can then move to manually fill the basin + press, to get the ingots."

				""
				"The lesson here is that in some cases some materials will be obtained from dusts, rather than ingots, and from processing small dusts or nuggets in some cases. So if something doesn't seem craftable, try to look further into these byproducts and see if another path opens up."

				""
				"Now let's move ACROSS. Extend the small cogwheel shaft and place onto that same pivot a large cogwheel, making sure it doesn't collide with already placed cogs.

If they share the same shaft and speed then it means this large cogwheel will turn at 4 RPM too."

				""

				"Let's just say that every machine and thing you add onto the same speed \"network\" contributes to an overall stress. If you add too much, all together. It will become overstessed and stop working."
				""
				"What you should keep in mind, is that the amount of sails you add not only increases the initial RPM, but also the stress capacity of the network:"

Next to the mixer a millstone, since it can connect directly to the mixer and get its own rotational power as well."

				""
				"This way of doing things takes a whole lot of space. The tricky part of Create automation is that it is bulky, and when you'll try to assemble different pieces together you'll keep having problems because you don't have enough space to fit the machines in that specific arrangement that would be required..."
				""
				"That's why there are blocks like gearboxes (and the vertical variant) to spare some space. The recipe is... somewhat accessible at this point, but quite a pain to make. So the choice is yours, either to make the useful blocks, or go the way of the tangle of gears until you are better placed in the progression."
				""
				"In any case, if you do everything correctly, you'll get to this point with all machines passively powered, but none of this is actual \"automation.\" To properly automate things you need infrastructure where machines transfer items (and fluids) between each other so that a whole processing line can be performed from a starting point to its ideal end."
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Yet again, you may have troubles setting up automation for the mixer. Let's say that cursed Andesite Alloy. In a mixer, you need two pieces of andesite dust, one of clay dust, one of quartz dust, and a zinc nugget. It's a ratio of 2 + 1 + 1 + 1."
				""
				"If any of these ingredients gets to 16 while waiting on the basin for the mixer, the block will stop accepting more items of that type. This has the consequence of \"clogging\" the process. Because the mixer may be waiting for all the four ingredients, but the other types can't get in because that path becomes blocked."
				""
				"So... Setting up a list filter and placing it on the basin, with andesite alloy selected, will make sure that the mixer will try to do that recipe. If you then place on one side of the basin a belt transporting items out, then automatically (or toggled with a wrench) the basin will produce a kind of chute on its side, meant to unload the finished product. In general you use a Create funnel to insert or extract items from a basin, but if you push items on one side with a funnel, and then place a funnel on the other side, the result will be that items come out as soon they get in from the other side. And nothing stays inside the mixer long enough for it to work."
				""
				"Using that \"built-in\" chute will instead be reserved to only extract the finished product (defined in the filter), without requiring \"smart\" components. And that chute will appear specifically if it has a belt under it."
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"But this also means that one side of that basin is occupied by that chute, leaving only three other sides to work with. You also need to deal with the fact that andesite alloy has the odd ratio of requiring two of andesite dust, and just one for the other ingredients."
				""
				"A solution that worked is: have a chest with one source ingredient (like andesite dust), have a funnel attached to the side of the chest, dropping items onto a belt, guiding these items one by one into another funnel placed on one free side of the basin. Since only one item type is placed in the chest, that means that the mixer-basin will be filled with a stack of 16 dusts, and then stop, as it will be out of space."
				""
				"On another free side of the basin you repeat this process. So that you also have a funnel going in, dedicated to one ingredient. This leaves ony one side of the mixer free, and yet still TWO ingredients that need to reach the mixer-basin."
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Maybe you can figure out a clever solution, but a simple and intuitive way to solve this problem is to make a structure with belts that looks like a \"&dT&r\". The central pillar of that letter is a belt going into the free side of the basin. The two small arms of the letter, instead, are two other belts, of the same length and speed, that drop items onto the main belt. If you then place a chest and funnel on EACH end of these two small arms of the letter, then they'll meet together as they reach the main one, and this should achieve a regular alternation of items on the main belt: A - B - A - B."
				""
				"If you do this correctly the mixer will never clog, because it will always contain a stack big enough to still run a recipe while waiting for the alternation of ingredients going into that side."
				""
				"On the image section of the modpack page, on CurseForge, scrolling to the bottom you should be able to find a poorly assembed thing that can still be used as a general reference of what I just described."
				""
				"Ideally, as long you have the same ratios, you can expand the \"T\" setup by placing two more \"T\"s sideways. So rather than being two to one, it becomes four to two and then two into one. Letting you insert four different ingredients by using just one side of the basin. Beware that if the recipe needs a fluid, then you'll always have one side fully occupied, since you need a pipe there."

				"As you come further down this page, the progression could start feeling messier, and an optimal path quite blurry. Things in Create continue to be too expensive to effectively automate."
				""
				"Far from offering ideal suggestions, my own path was this:"
				""
				"- &eStart a quarry in the nether&r, for quartz"
				"- &eStart a quarry for coal&r (because you'll need lots of fuel)"
				"- Quarries stop too quicky, &ebuffer coal and water&r, as described in the dedicated page for the quarry system"
				"- &eAutomate cogwheels&r. This is major hurdle. Need to expand windmill system, make 5 deployers, craft a brass funnel so that it's possible to loop the deploy step for the 8 copper nuggets."
				"- After that, you may either be looking for &ea lignite quarry&r, then &ecopper&r and eventually &etin&r, to keep up with demands without having to go mine. "

				"It will take a long time getting there. But the stuggle is required to progressively make things... eaiser."

				"Probably only after these steps it will become more reasonable to progress over to the real bronze age."
